# Introduction #

DraftMaster is designed for use as a drafting application and possesses superior logic and a new and unique AI for the player's rival drafters. At the end of your draft, when you save your draft, DraftMaster automatically creates a deck for you that fits your two most commonly drafted colors and provides a sideboard should you wish to revise it. About half of M10 comes with DraftMaster on initial download. Currently, the decks are only saved as smart-draft files and are compressed.

When you start DraftMaster, begin by configuring a draft. Do this by using the Up-Down control (in the upper left hand corner of the application window) to set how many booster packs you want to draft, then pressing the **New Draft** button (on the left of the Up-Down control). Then, choose what sets you would like the draft to contain. Choose sets one at a time using the Drop-Down selection (just below the **New Draft** button), and press the **Add** button (right next to the Drop-Down selection) to make the next booster pack (indicated by a blue arrow) be created from that set. Continue until all packs have been configured.

You then ought to see 15 cards in a list (the taller one) in the middle of the application window , color coded to indicate their color. Click on one of those items to select it and show that card's image and any tips. Draft this card by clicking the **Pick** button (in the lower right hand corner of the this list), and it will be added to the smaller list (just below the **Pick** button). You can also click and view the image and tips of cards in this box, but you cannot pick them.

Once you have finished drafting, the **Pick** button will become a **Save** button. Click on this button (located exactly where the **Pick** button was) to save your draft in the smart-draft format. Just tell the program where to save your file and give that file a name, click save, and the program will create a two-color deck for you using your two most commonly drafted colors as well as supply all lands required.
