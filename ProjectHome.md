DraftMaster is designed for use as a drafting application and possesses superior logic and a new and unique NPC Logic for the player's rival drafters. At the end of your draft, when you save your draft, DraftMaster automatically creates a deck for you that fits your two most commonly drafted colors and provides a sideboard should you wish to revise it.
About half of M10 comes with DraftMaster on initial download. Currently, the decks are only saved as smart-draft files and are compressed.

NPC Logic

---

NPCs draft cards based on the cards' ratings, and in essence choose the best card. For the first five picks, they draft the highest rated card with the highest rarity. After that, they choose cards within the two most commonly occurring colors of their picks. They prefer to draft decks in which the nonland cards are about 2/3 creatures, and will pick suitably. Moreover, the NPCs draft cards based on the mana curve of their decks. Even if they need creature cards, if the only available creature(s) cost would disrupt their deck's curve, they choose a different card.

DraftMaster's innovative logic comes from its Player Rating System, which takes the average turn a player picked a card and, if the card has been drafted at least 10 times, is used by the Logic to evaluate the card instead of the default rating.
This allows for DraftMaster to adapt to a player and their valuation of cards. For example, if you force red every time and highly pick red cards, over time, the NPC Logic will start drafting red more often, leaving you with fewer red cards than you used to get. As you stabilize, the NPC will stabilize to your values, and become more "entrenched" in its old "ways of thought", making it harder for you to change its perception of a card's rating or value.
